    <h1>Image Tag Example with Comments</h1>

    <!-- Basic image with src and alt -->
    <h2>Basic Image</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300" alt="Placeholder image" />

    <p>
      This is a basic image tag with the src and alt attributes. The src
      specifies the image path, and alt provides a description for
      accessibility.
    </p>

    <!-- Image with lazy loading -->
    <h2>Image with Lazy Loading</h2>
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
      alt="Lazy loaded image"
      loading="lazy"
    />

    <p>
      This image will only load when it's about to come into view on the screen
      (lazy loading). It's beneficial for performance, especially with many
      images on a page.
    </p>

    <!-- Image with srcset and sizes (Responsive Image) -->
    <h2>Responsive Image</h2>
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/400"
      srcset="
        https://via.placeholder.com/400   400w,
        https://via.placeholder.com/800   800w,
        https://via.placeholder.com/1200 1200w
      "
      sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"
      alt="Responsive image"
    />

    <p>
      This is a responsive image. The browser will choose the best image based
      on the screen width and resolution. The sizes attribute defines how much
      space the image should occupy depending on the viewport width.
    </p>

    <!-- Image with async decoding -->
    <h2>Image with Async Decoding</h2>
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
      alt="Async decoded image"
      decoding="async"
    />

    <p>
      This image has async decoding enabled. It allows the browser to continue
      rendering the page while the image is being decoded, improving perceived
      page performance.
    </p>

    <!-- Security tips: No external user-generated images in this example, but if you were handling uploads, always sanitize and verify -->
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      When dealing with user-uploaded images, ensure that you validate file
      types and sanitize the paths to prevent any malicious content.
    </p>

    <!-- Image with object-fit (for cards, banners, etc.) -->
    <h2>Image with object-fit</h2>
    <div style="width: 300px; height: 200px; overflow: hidden">
      <img
        src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
        alt="Object-fit example"
        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover"
      />
    </div>

    <p>
      By using <code>object-fit: cover</code>, the image will cover the entire
      area of the container, cropping the image if necessary while preserving
      the aspect ratio.
    </p>

    <!-- Image with height and width attributes -->
    <h2>Image with Width and Height Attributes</h2>
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
      alt="Image with width and height"
      width="300"
      height="200"
    />

    <p>
      Adding the width and height attributes to the image helps the browser
      allocate space for the image before it loads, improving the page layout.
