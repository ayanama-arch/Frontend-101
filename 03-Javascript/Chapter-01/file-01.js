// JavaScript Introduction

// JavaScript was initially created to make web pages "alive", meaning it brings interactivity to the web
// It's executed as plain text in the browser, and doesn't need to be compiled.

// Why is it called JavaScript?
// Initially named "LiveScript", it was renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time.
// However, JavaScript is not related to Java at all. It evolved into its own independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript.

// JavaScript Engines:
// JavaScript runs inside an engine. Each browser has its own engine, examples include:
// V8 (Chrome, Opera, Edge), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Chakra (IE), JavaScriptCore (Safari)
// The engine parses and compiles JavaScript into machine code for the browser to execute.

// What JavaScript can do in the browser:
// 1. Manipulate HTML content: Add new content or modify existing content dynamically
// 2. Respond to user actions: Can listen to mouse clicks, key presses, etc.
// 3. Make network requests: Can send and receive data from remote servers using technologies like AJAX
// 4. Handle cookies: Can read/write cookies to store small amounts of data
// 5. Local storage: Can store data locally on the user's browser to persist between sessions

// What JavaScript can't do in the browser (Security restrictions):
// 1. No access to the file system: JavaScript can't read or write arbitrary files without user interaction
// 2. Can't execute system-level programs or gain access to OS functions
// 3. Can't silently access a user's camera or microphone without explicit permission
// 4. Tabs/windows generally cannot communicate with each other, unless from the same origin (Same-Origin Policy)

// What makes JavaScript unique:
// 1. Fully integrated with HTML/CSS: JavaScript manipulates the DOM and CSSOM directly to update the web page dynamically
// 2. Simple and fast for simple tasks
// 3. Supported by all major browsers, making it universally accessible on the web

// Languages "over" JavaScript:
// There are languages that compile (transpile) to JavaScript, providing additional features or simpler syntax:
// 1. CoffeeScript: A syntactic sugar over JavaScript for cleaner and shorter code.
// 2. TypeScript: Adds static typing for better tooling and error checking (developed by Microsoft).
// 3. Flow: Adds static typing with a focus on optional, less strict types (developed by Facebook).
// 4. Dart: Developed by Google, can be compiled to JavaScript or used standalone in environments like mobile apps.
// 5. Brython: Transpiles Python to JavaScript, allowing Python developers to write browser-based apps in Python.
// 6. Kotlin: A modern language that can target both browser and server-side (Node.js).

// Summary:
// JavaScript started as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments (e.g., Node.js for server-side).
// It remains the most popular and widely-supported language in browsers, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.
// Many new languages transpile to JavaScript, and it’s worth exploring them once you master JavaScript itself.

// Specification: ECMA-262
// The ECMA-262 specification is the most formal and detailed document on JavaScript.
// It defines the language's core features and standards.
// This specification is highly formal and not ideal for beginners due to its technical depth.
// A new version is released annually, with the latest draft available at:
// https://tc39.es/ecma262/
// Proposals for new features (stage 3) can be found at:
// https://github.com/tc39/proposals

// ECMA-262 defines the official version of JavaScript, and it's the go-to resource for accurate language details.

// Specification Draft:
// For the newest JavaScript features (still under development or "stage 3"), you can follow proposals here:
// https://github.com/tc39/proposals

// Manuals: MDN JavaScript Reference
// The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is one of the most reliable and comprehensive resources for JavaScript.
// MDN provides documentation on JavaScript functions, methods, examples, and more:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference
// It's often best to search for specific topics via Google using "MDN [term]" for quick results.
// Example search for parseInt function:
// https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt

// Compatibility Tables:
// JavaScript is a constantly evolving language with new features being added.
// It's essential to check whether a new feature is supported by different browsers and engines.

// The compatibility of JavaScript features can be checked on these websites:
// 1. https://caniuse.com – Displays feature support across various browsers and engines (e.g., cryptography functions).
// 2. https://kangax.github.io/compat-table – Shows a detailed table with language features and support by different engines.

// These resources help developers to verify whether certain JavaScript features will work across various environments.
