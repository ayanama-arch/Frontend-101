// Developer Console - A Powerful Tool for Debugging JavaScript Errors

// Code errors are common in JavaScript, and browsers offer tools to help us identify and fix them.
// The browser developer tools display errors and provide many other useful features for debugging scripts.

// Most developers use Chrome or Firefox for development because they have the best developer tools.

// **Google Chrome**:
// To open the developer tools in Chrome, press F12 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Opt + J (Mac).
// The developer tools window will open, showing the Console tab by default.

// Example:
// In the "Console" tab, you'll see error messages. For example, an unknown command like 'lalala' will display as a red error message:
// Error: lalala is not defined at bug.html:12 (line number 12 indicates where the error occurred).

// Below the error message, there is a blue '> symbol' where you can type JavaScript commands. Press Enter to run commands.

// We can use the console to input JavaScript commands for testing and debugging while working on scripts.

// **Multi-Line Input**:
// Normally, pressing Enter runs the code entered in the console.
// To insert multiple lines of code, press Shift + Enter, which allows you to input long scripts in a more structured way.

// **Firefox, Edge, and Other Browsers**:
// Other modern browsers like Firefox and Edge use the F12 key to open developer tools.
// Their developer tools look similar to Chrome, so once you're familiar with one, you can switch to others easily.

// **Safari (Mac Only)**:
// Safari requires a bit of setup to access developer tools.
// First, enable the "Develop menu" in Safari Preferences > Advanced pane, then check "Show Develop menu in the menu bar".

// Once enabled, use Cmd + Opt + C to open the console.
// The "Develop" menu will now appear with additional options and commands for debugging.

// **Summary**:
// Developer tools are essential for debugging JavaScript.
// They allow us to view errors, execute commands, examine variables, and test code directly in the browser.
// Most browsers use F12 to open the developer tools.
// Chrome for Mac uses Cmd + Opt + J, while Safari requires enabling the "Develop menu" first.
