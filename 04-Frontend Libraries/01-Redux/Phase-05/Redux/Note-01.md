# Redux Q&A Guide - Complete Reference

## 📚 Basic Concepts

### 1. What is Redux and what problem does it solve?

Redux is a **predictable state container** for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a centralized way to manage application state, especially in complex apps where data needs to be shared across multiple components.

**Problems Redux solves:**

- **State sharing** between components
- **Predictable state updates**
- **Easier debugging** and testing
- **Time-travel debugging** capabilities

---

### 2. Explain the three core principles of Redux

#### 🏪 **Single Source of Truth**

The entire application state is stored in a single store object tree.

#### 🔒 **State is Read-Only**

The only way to change state is by dispatching actions - never mutate state directly.

#### 🔄 **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**

Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state.

---

### 3. What is a store in Redux and how do you create one?

The **Redux Store** is the central hub that holds your application's state. It's a JavaScript object with methods like `dispatch()`, `getState()`, and `subscribe()`.

```javascript
import { createStore } from "redux";

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

---

### 4. What are actions in Redux? Provide an example

**Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened. They must have a `type` property and can optionally include a `payload`.

```javascript
// Action object
const incrementAction = {
  type: "counter/increment",
  payload: 2,
};

// Dispatching an action
store.dispatch(incrementAction);
```

---

### 5. What are action creators and why are they useful?

**Action creators** are functions that return action objects. They promote code reusability, consistency, and maintainability.

```javascript
// Action creator function
function addTodo(text) {
  return {
    type: "ADD_TODO",
    payload: text,
  };
}

// Usage
store.dispatch(addTodo("Learn Redux"));
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Reusable** - Use the same action creator multiple times
- ✅ **Consistent** - Ensures action structure is always correct
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update action format in one place

---

### 6. What is a reducer in Redux? What are the rules for writing reducers?

A **reducer** is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, then returns a new state.

```javascript
function counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "counter/increment":
      return { ...state, count: state.count + action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

**Rules for reducers:**

- ✅ Must be **pure functions**
- ✅ Must **return new state** (never mutate existing state)
- ✅ Must handle **unknown actions** by returning current state
- ✅ Must not have **side effects**

---

### 7. Explain the concept of immutability in Redux. Why is it important?

**Immutability** means never modifying existing state directly. Instead, create and return a new copy of the state with changes.

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong - Mutating state
state.count++;

// ✅ Correct - Creating new state
return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
```

**Why immutability is important:**

- ✅ **Predictability** - Changes are controlled and traceable
- ✅ **Time Travel Debugging** - Can step through state history
- ✅ **Performance** - Shallow equality checks for re-renders
- ✅ **Avoids Bugs** - Prevents accidental state mutations

---

### 8. What is the difference between state and props in the context of Redux?

| Redux State                  | Props                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Global application data      | Data passed from parent to child |
| Managed by Redux store       | Managed by React components      |
| Accessed via `useSelector`   | Passed as component parameters   |
| Updated via actions/reducers | Updated by parent component      |

---

### 9. What is a dispatch function and how is it used?

`dispatch()` is a function used to send actions to the Redux store. It's the **only way** to trigger state changes.

```javascript
// Get dispatch function
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// Dispatch an action
dispatch({ type: "counter/increment", payload: 1 });

// Or with action creator
dispatch(incrementCounter(1));
```

---

### 10. What is the Redux data flow? Explain the unidirectional data flow

Redux follows a **strict unidirectional data flow**:

```
UI Component → dispatch(action) → Reducer → New State → UI Updates
```

**Step by step:**

1. **UI Event** - User clicks button
2. **Dispatch Action** - Component dispatches an action
3. **Reducer Called** - Store calls reducer with current state and action
4. **New State** - Reducer returns new state
5. **UI Updates** - Components re-render with new state

---

## 🛠️ Intermediate Redux

### 11. What are pure functions and why must reducers be pure functions?

**Pure functions** are functions that:

- Return the same output for the same input
- Have no side effects (no API calls, mutations, etc.)

```javascript
// ✅ Pure function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// ❌ Not pure - has side effect
function add(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b); // Side effect!
  return a + b;
}
```

**Why reducers must be pure:**

- ✅ **Predictable** - Same action always produces same result
- ✅ **Testable** - Easy to unit test
- ✅ **Time-travel debugging** - Can replay actions reliably
- ✅ **Performance** - Enables optimizations

---

### 12. How do you handle asynchronous operations in Redux?

Redux is **synchronous by default**. For async operations, use middleware like **Redux Thunk** or **Redux Saga**.

```javascript
// With Redux Thunk
const fetchUser = (userId) => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: "user/fetchStart" });
    try {
      const user = await api.getUser(userId);
      dispatch({ type: "user/fetchSuccess", payload: user });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({ type: "user/fetchError", payload: error.message });
    }
  };
};
```

---

### 13. What is middleware in Redux? Explain how it works

**Middleware** sits between dispatching an action and the reducer receiving it. It can intercept, modify, log, delay, or cancel actions.

```javascript
// Custom logger middleware
const logger = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  console.log("Dispatching:", action);
  const result = next(action);
  console.log("New state:", store.getState());
  return result;
};

// Apply middleware
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(logger));
```

**Common middleware:**

- 🔄 **Redux Thunk** - Handle async actions
- 📝 **Redux Logger** - Log actions and state
- 🛡️ **Redux Saga** - Handle complex async flows

---

### 14. What is Redux Thunk and when would you use it?

**Redux Thunk** is middleware that allows you to write action creators that return functions instead of plain action objects.

```javascript
// Thunk action creator
const fetchTodos = () => {
  return async (dispatch, getState) => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/todos");
    const todos = await response.json();
    dispatch({ type: "todos/loaded", payload: todos });
  };
};

// Usage
dispatch(fetchTodos());
```

**When to use Redux Thunk:**

- 🌐 **API calls**
- ⏱️ **Delayed actions**
- 🔄 **Conditional dispatching**
- 📊 **Access to current state**

---

### 15. How do you combine multiple reducers in Redux?

Use `combineReducers()` to merge multiple reducers into one root reducer.

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  posts: postsReducer,
  comments: commentsReducer,
});

// State shape will be:
// {
//   user: { ... },
//   posts: { ... },
//   comments: { ... }
// }
```

---

### 16. What is the purpose of `combineReducers()` function?

`combineReducers()` combines multiple slice reducers into a single root reducer.

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Modular** - Keep related logic together
- ✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new features
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Smaller, focused reducers
- ✅ **Team-friendly** - Different developers can work on different slices

---

### 17. Explain the concept of normalizing state shape in Redux

**Normalization** means structuring state as flat objects (like a database) instead of nested arrays/objects.

#### ❌ **Without Normalization:**

```javascript
{
  users: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "John",
      posts: [
        { id: 101, title: "Hello World" },
        { id: 102, title: "Learning Redux" },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

🔴 Hard to update individual posts or users

#### ✅ **With Normalization:**

```javascript
{
  users: {
    byId: {
      1: { id: 1, name: "John", postIds: [101, 102] }
    },
    allIds: [1]
  },
  posts: {
    byId: {
      101: { id: 101, title: "Hello World" },
      102: { id: 102, title: "Learning Redux" }
    },
    allIds: [101, 102]
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Fast lookups** by ID
- ✅ **Easy updates** - change one place
- ✅ **No duplication** - single source of truth
- ✅ **Shallow equality** - better performance

💡 **Tip:** Use Redux Toolkit's `createEntityAdapter` for automatic normalization.

---

### 18. What are the common patterns for organizing Redux code?

#### 🗂️ **Feature-based Structure**

```
src/
  features/
    users/
      userSlice.js
      userAPI.js
      UserList.jsx
    posts/
      postSlice.js
      postAPI.js
      PostList.jsx
```

#### 🏗️ **Type-based Structure**

```
src/
  actions/
    userActions.js
    postActions.js
  reducers/
    userReducer.js
    postReducer.js
  components/
    UserList.jsx
    PostList.jsx
```

**Recommended:** Feature-based structure for better maintainability.

---

### 19. How do you handle nested state updates in Redux?

Use the **spread operator** or helper libraries like **Immer** to handle nested updates immutably.

```javascript
// With spread operator
return {
  ...state,
  user: {
    ...state.user,
    profile: {
      ...state.user.profile,
      name: action.payload,
    },
  },
};

// With Immer (Redux Toolkit uses this internally)
return produce(state, (draft) => {
  draft.user.profile.name = action.payload;
});
```

---

### 20. What is the difference between `getState()` and accessing state directly?

| `getState()`                  | Direct Access                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Gets current state from store | Accesses state snapshot            |
| Always returns latest state   | May return stale state             |
| Used in middleware/thunks     | Used in components                 |
| `store.getState()`            | `useSelector(state => state.user)` |

---

## 🚀 Advanced Redux

### 21. What are enhancers in Redux? How do they differ from middleware?

**Enhancers** are higher-order functions that enhance the store itself, while **middleware** sits between dispatch and reducers.

```javascript
// Enhancer - modifies store creation
const enhancer = (createStore) => (reducer, preloadedState) => {
  const store = createStore(reducer, preloadedState);
  return {
    ...store,
    dispatch: (action) => {
      console.log("Enhanced dispatch:", action);
      return store.dispatch(action);
    },
  };
};

// Middleware - intercepts actions
const middleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  console.log("Middleware action:", action);
  return next(action);
};
```

**Key differences:**

- **Enhancers** modify the store itself
- **Middleware** processes actions before they reach reducers

---

### 22. How do you implement custom middleware in Redux?

Middleware follows the pattern: `store => next => action => result`

```javascript
// Logger middleware
const logger = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  console.log("Dispatching:", action);
  console.log("Current state:", store.getState());

  const result = next(action);

  console.log("New state:", store.getState());
  return result;
};

// API middleware
const apiMiddleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  if (action.type === "API_REQUEST") {
    fetch(action.url)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) =>
        store.dispatch({
          type: "API_SUCCESS",
          payload: data,
        })
      );
  }
  return next(action);
};

// Apply middleware
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(logger, apiMiddleware));
```

---

### 23. What is time-travel debugging in Redux?

**Time-travel debugging** allows you to step through your application's state history, viewing previous states and replaying actions.

**Features:**

- ✅ **Step backward/forward** through actions
- ✅ **View state** at any point in time
- ✅ **Replay actions** to reproduce bugs
- ✅ **Skip actions** to test different scenarios

**Tools:**

- 🛠️ **Redux DevTools Extension**
- 🔍 **React DevTools**

```javascript
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
);
```

---

### 24. How do you handle optimistic updates in Redux?

**Optimistic updates** immediately update the UI assuming the operation will succeed, then handle failures.

```javascript
// Optimistic update pattern
const addTodoOptimistic = (text) => {
  return async (dispatch, getState) => {
    const tempId = Date.now();

    // 1. Immediately update UI
    dispatch({
      type: "todos/addOptimistic",
      payload: { id: tempId, text, status: "pending" },
    });

    try {
      // 2. Send API request
      const response = await api.addTodo(text);

      // 3. Replace temp todo with real one
      dispatch({
        type: "todos/addSuccess",
        payload: { tempId, todo: response.data },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // 4. Remove temp todo on failure
      dispatch({
        type: "todos/addFailure",
        payload: { tempId, error: error.message },
      });
    }
  };
};
```

---

### 25. What are the performance considerations when using Redux?

#### 🎯 **Component Optimization**

```javascript
// Use React.memo for components
const TodoItem = React.memo(({ todo, onToggle }) => {
  return <li onClick={() => onToggle(todo.id)}>{todo.text}</li>;
});

// Use specific selectors
const todoCount = useSelector((state) => state.todos.length);
// Instead of: useSelector(state => state.todos).length
```

#### 🏗️ **State Structure**

- ✅ **Normalize state** - Avoid deeply nested objects
- ✅ **Split large reducers** - Use `combineReducers`
- ✅ **Keep serializable data** - No functions or class instances

#### 🔄 **Selector Optimization**

```javascript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(
  [state => state.todos, state => state.filter],
  (todos, filter) => {
    // Expensive computation only runs when todos or filter changes
    return todos.filter(todo => /* filtering logic */);
  }
);
```

#### 📦 **Redux Toolkit Benefits**

- ✅ **Built-in Immer** - Handles immutability
- ✅ **Memoized selectors** - Better performance
- ✅ **Serializable checks** - Development warnings
- ✅ **Smaller bundle size** - Optimized for production

#### 🚀 **Advanced Optimizations**

- ✅ **Code splitting** - Lazy load reducers
- ✅ **Batch actions** - Combine multiple dispatches
- ✅ **Virtualization** - For large lists
- ✅ **Shallow equality** - For `useSelector`
